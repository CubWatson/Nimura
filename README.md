## Special Project: Nimura! Your new home.

Nimura is a modpack specifically crafted for those who want something new to explore and experience. Something challenging and exciting, but not something that is too heavy on performance and features.

Some people may enjoy adventuring, but their modpack may have too many tech mods. Some people may enjoy tech mods, but maybe their modpack has too many dungeon mods. Nimura aims to be a balance.. Just enough tech mods, adventure mods, worldgen mods, cooking mods, utility mods, and magic mods to give you a wonderful experience, but not overwhelm you with too much 'extra stuff'.

**Note: It is recommended to dedicate 8GB (-Xmx8G -Xms8G) of RAM to this modpack. Should be fine with Multiplayer and Singleplayer.**
